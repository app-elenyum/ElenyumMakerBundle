## Introduction

The Elenyum Module Bundle is a flexible and dynamic tool for creating APIs and modular systems using the [Elenyum Specification Language (ESL)](doc/DOC_ESL.md). [ESL](doc/DOC_ESL.md) is a JSON-based format designed to simplify and automate the generation of APIs. This bundle provides a way to define data structures, relationships, validation rules, and constraints in a straightforward JSON format, allowing developers to focus on building applications without being overwhelmed by configuration and boilerplate code.
